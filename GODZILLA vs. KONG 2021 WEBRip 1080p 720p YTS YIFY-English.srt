1
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
She's waiting for me

2
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Mm.

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
to let my love pass

4
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Alert, biodome breach.

5
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Alert, biodome breach.

6
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Dr. Andrews, did you see that?

7
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The habitat's not gonna
hold much longer.

8
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We need to start thinking
about off-site solutions.

9
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The island is the one thing
that's kept him isolated.

10
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If he leaves,
Godzilla will come for him.

11
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
There can't be
two alpha Titans.

12
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The whole theory
of an ancient rivalry

13
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
stems from Iwi mythology.

14
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
He's gotten too big over time.

15
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This environment
won't sustain much longer.

16
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's too unstable.

17
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Hey.

18
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Off-site would be
a death sentence.

19
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You don't think the King
could take care of himself?

20
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
There has to be another way.

21
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Finding the origin
of these creatures

22
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
is essential
to mankind's survival.

23
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The interior
of the Earth

24
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
is made up of vast cabins
and air pockets,

25
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
joined by natural avenues.

26
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The admiral
begins his expedition,

27
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
searching for an entrance
to a hidden world.

28
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The purpose
is the discovery

29
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and the release to the world

30
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
of the unknown treasures
of Antarctica

31
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
in the interests
of all mankind.

32
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Members of the lost
party were never seen again.

33
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Still no word
on what may have happened.

34
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
There's an ecosystem
out there,

35
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
the likes of which
we can't imagine.

36
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And the place to find it
is this island.

37
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Hello, loyal listeners.

38
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Welcome to  TTP,
Titan Truth Podcast.

39
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Episode number 245.

40
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Today is the day.

41
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Maybe the last podcast
I ever record.

42
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And look, I know
I said that last week

43
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and maybe the week before
and a few other times.

44
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But, look, this is the point.

45
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
After five years of deep cover
at Apex Cybernetics,

46
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm finally taking my shot.

47
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Something bad
is going on here.

48
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I don't know what it is,

49
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
but I'm about to walk in
and download hard evidence

50
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
and expose
a vast corporate conspiracy.

51
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah, you can call me
a whistleblower,

52
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
but I ain't just whistling.

53
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I mean, this is more
than a leak. It's a flood.

54
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And believe me, this flood

55
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
is gonna wash away
all of Apex's lies.

56
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You can believe that.

57
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Welcome to Apex Cybernetics.

58
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
No unauthorized persons
allowed beyond this point.

59
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
When we started
Apex Cybernetics,

60
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
we dreamt of new ways

61
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
to push past the limits
of human potential.

62
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Robotics, the human mind,
artificial intelligence.

63
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Who knows what brave new
future we'll dream of next?

64
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm Walter Simmons,

65
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and it is my privilege
to lead Apex

66
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
into humanity's bold new era.

67
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We're not going anywhere.

68
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And neither are you.

69
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
There you are, baby.

70
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
No, don't eat that!

71
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's incredibly unhealthy.

72
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's just all the GMOs.

73
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Growing a second head
could be useful.

74
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You have to let me know.

75
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Because me, myself?

76
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I can barely handle
the one I got.

77
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Bernie, you're not
supposed to be in here.

78
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You ever wonder
what we're really doing here?

79
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I mean, really doing here.

80
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Why are you here?

81
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This isn't Engineering.

82
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Because, you know,
I had to wait

83
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
because they're rendering
these new specs,

84
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
which is gonna
take over, uh...

85
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's calculator mode.

86
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
...over one hour,
maybe even more.

87
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So my foreman told me
to just take a walk

88
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
-and make some new friends.
-Oh.

89
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Oh! Now that
we're new friends,

90
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I can share something
with you, right?

91
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I know it's in here somewhere.

92
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This is hand sanitizer that
I made from my own garden.

93
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's really amazing.

94
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Don't know
if I used that or not.

95
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yes. This. Check this out.

96
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That right there
is radio mesh networking

97
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
with a voice-record
subprocessor.

98
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
-Guess from where. Come on.
-I don't care.

99
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's from a toaster.
Look at this thing.

100
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I have to go to the bathroom.

101
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Is it one or two?

102
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
'Cause if it's two, it's
probably from these apples.

103
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Hey, you wanna use the
hand sanitizer that I made?

104
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm good.

105
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay, I'll just stay here.

106
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Okay. Yeah.

107
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Ah, let's see.

108
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Whoo.

109
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Screen.

110
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What are they shipping
to Hong Kong?

111
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What's Sublevel 33?

112
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What the...?

113
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
-

114
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Evacuation, Titan alert.

115
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This is not a drill.

116
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
All Apex employees,
please proceed...

117
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That is my cue. That's my cue.

118
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
This is not a drill.

119
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Proceed to the fallout shelter
in a single-file line.

120
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Let's go!

121
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
They used
cyanide capsules

122
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
instead of fallout shelters
to keep the secrets in,

123
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
but, you know,
that's neither here nor there,

124
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
so don't listen to me.

125
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Level two personnel,
this way! Let's go, let's go!

126
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah, that way.

127
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's time!

128
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We need to go now!

129
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Evacuate.

130
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
One level at a time, okay.

131
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
-No.
-Hey, you!

132
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
-Where's your clearance tag?
-You know what?

133
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The fact that
you're talking about

134
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
clearance tags right now
in a time of crisis

135
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
is incredibly unprofessional.

136
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
We should be talking
about evacuation.

137
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
-Yo! Okay!

138
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
-

139
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
-

140
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Oh, my God.

141
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Oh, no. What the hell is that?

142
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This is CNN breaking news.

143
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The United States
Navy's Fourth Fleet

144
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
is deployed off
the southeastern seaboard

145
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
of the U.S. after last night's
sudden Godzilla attack.

146
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
A time of
relative peace shattered

147
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
when the massive Titan,

148
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
once thought to be
a hero to humanity,

149
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
made landfall
in Pensacola, Florida.

150
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
While the damage
was largely contained

151
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
to the U.S. headquarters
of Apex Cybernetics,

152
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
governments around the world
aren't taking any chances

153
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
after the first substantiated
Titan sighting

154
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
in over three years.

155
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
CEO Walter Simmons
had this to say.

156
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's about working together
to ensure a safer world.

157
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Godzilla's a threat
to humanity,

158
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and Apex has a plan
to deal with it,

159
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
-once and for all.
-

160
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Students and faculty,

161
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
a mandatory assembly
will be held

162
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
at 2:00 p.m. this afternoon.

163
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Guidance counselors
will also be holding

164
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
additional office hours
all this week

165
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
for individual
and group sessions.

166
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Welcome back, loyal listeners,

167
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
to  Titan Truth Podcast,
episode 246.

168
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Oh, my God. I was there.

169
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Godzilla's Apex attack.
I saw it go down!

170
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You think it's a coincidence
that he reappears

171
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
and just so happens to destroy
that specific facility?

172
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Ha-ha, no, no, no, no.
No such thing as coincidence.

173
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Dad, I'm telling you,

174
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
provoking him
that we're not seeing here.

175
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Why else would Godzilla
flash an intimidation display

176
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
if there wasn't
another Titan around?

177
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That podcast is filling
your head with garbage.

178
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
-You should be in school.
-I am just trying to help.

179
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I don't want you to help.
I want you to stay safe.

180
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We needed a plan to keep peace
with these things,

181
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and the best one we had
just went down in flames.

182
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I don't have any more.

183
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And the last thing that I need
is to be worrying about you.

184
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Godzilla saved us. You were
there with Mom. You saw it.

185
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
How could you doubt him?

186
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
-There has to be a pattern.
-There doesn't.

187
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
-A reason why he was provoked.
-There isn't.

188
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
How do you know that?

189
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Because creatures,
like people, can change.

190
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And right now,
Godzilla's out there

191
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
and he's hurting people,
and we don't know why.

192
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So cut your pop some slack,
would ya?

193
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
See you at home, Dad.

194
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You wanna know
my theory?

195
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I mean, of course you do.
That's why you're here.

196
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Come on, it's all about
patterns and variables.

197
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Oh, wait, stick with me.
I'm gonna take you back

198
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
to sixth grade with this,
okay?

199
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Godzilla attacks when
provoked, that's the pattern.

200
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Pensacola is
the only coastal Apex hub

201
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
with an advanced robotics lab.

202
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That's the variable.

203
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And add them up
and your answer is

204
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
that Apex is at the heart
of the problem.

205
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
-

206
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Can I help you?

207
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
If you want an appointment,

208
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
my office hours
are nine to five.

209
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Please, Dr. Lind.
-What the f...

210
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Guys like you and me,

211
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
we don't do normal hours,
do we?

212
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I've been fixated
on Hollow Earth

213
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
for as long as you have.

214
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Your theory that it's
the birthplace of all Titans

215
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
is fascinating.

216
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Your book was very impressive.

217
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Oh, yeah? Well, I got
about 30 unsold boxes

218
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
in my apartment
if you want some.

219
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Walt Simmons.

220
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I know who you are, sir.
It's an honor.

221
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
No, the honor is mine.
As is the urgency.

222
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Godzilla has never attacked us
unprovoked before.

223
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
These are dangerous times,
Dr. Lind.

224
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Allow me to introduce

225
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
our Apex chief technology
officer, Mr. Ren Serizawa.

226
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
He has an interesting thing
to show you.

227
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Magnetic imaging from
one of our new satellites.

228
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You know what this is, right?

229
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Hollow Earth.

230
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
An ecosystem
as vast as any ocean,

231
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
right beneath our feet.

232
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
This energy signal
is enormous.

233
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And almost identical
to readings from  Gojira.

234
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
As our sun
fuels the planet's surface,

235
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
this energy sustains
the Hollow Earth,

236
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
enabling life as powerful as
our aggressive Titan friend.

237
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
If we can harness
this life force,

238
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
we'll have a weapon that can
compete with Godzilla.

239
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I need your help to find it.

240
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I don't know if I'm
the right guy for the job.

241
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Did you read the reviews?

242
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
"A sci-fi quack
trading in fringe physics."

243
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Look where they put my office.

244
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm in the basement
right across from flute class.

245
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Besides, I'm not
with Monarch anymore.

246
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And Hollow Earth entry
is impossible.

247
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
We tried.

248
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm sorry about your brother.

249
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
He was a true pioneer.

250
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Thanks.

251
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
See, all of our forward scans

252
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
suggest a habitable
environment down there.

253
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So, what really went wrong
on your brother's mission?

254
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
When they tried to enter,

255
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
they hit
a gravitational inversion.

256
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
A whole planet's worth
of gravity

257
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
reversed in a split second.

258
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
They were crushed
in an instant.

259
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What if I told you
that we, at Apex,

260
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
have created
a phenomenal craft

261
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
which could sustain
such an inversion?

262
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
The Hollow Earth
Aerial Vehicle.

263
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
HEAV.

264
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
We can make the journey

265
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
to Hollow Earth possible,
Dr. Lind.

266
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
But we need you
to lead the mission.

267
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Help me.

268
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Help everyone.

269
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Finding this needle
in a haystack

270
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
is our best shot
against Godzilla.

271
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Well, I, uh,
might have an idea.

272
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
But it's crazy.

273
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I love crazy ideas.
They made me rich.

274
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Are you guys familiar
with genetic memory?

275
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's a theory that all Titans
share a common impulse

276
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
to return
to their evolutionary source.

277
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Like spawning salmon.

278
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Exactly. Or a...
Or a homing pigeon.

279
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So if this is the Titans' home

280
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
and this life force
sustains them...

281
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
A Titan
could show you the way.

282
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yeah.

283
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
With a little help
of an old colleague.

284
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Ugh, where is it?

285
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Dr. Andrews,
you have a visitor

286
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Okay.

287
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
A power source
in Hollow Earth?

288
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
This sounds nuts, Nathan,
even for you.

289
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's there! We just
need Kong to bring us to it!

290
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
The second you take
Kong out of containment,

291
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Godzilla's gonna come for him.

292
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You said you can't
keep him here forever.

293
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
No. Our meddling
has already wreaked havoc

294
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
on Kong's habitat.

295
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
No way am I
letting you drag him

296
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
halfway across the world
to use him as a weapon.

297
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
No, not as a weapon.
As an ally.

298
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
To protect us,
lead the way down there.

299
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What even makes you think
that he'll go in?

300
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You always believed
that Skull Island

301
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
was like Hollow Earth
come to the surface, right?

302
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And that's where Kong's
ancestors came from.

303
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Mm-hmm.

304
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Through the entrance
in Antarctica,

305
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
we could help him
find a new home.

306
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And he could save ours.

307
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Hers.

308
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
That power source
may be our only hope.

309
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
We gotta stop Godzilla.
This is our only chance.

310
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
We have to take it.

311
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
-Okay.
-Yes!

312
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
But when it comes to Kong,
what I say goes.

313
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You name the terms. Thank you.

314
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Sorry. Thank you.

315
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You won't regret this.

316
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
-Mm, I already regret this.
-

317
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Come on.

318
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
that he'd rather roam

319
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
he'd rather be alone

320
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
see me now

321
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
in the wind

322
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
that I can

323
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
and longing for

324
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Whoo! Jeez,
I can smell him from up here.

325
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Well, he can smell you, too.

326
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Still not a fan, huh?

327
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What's she saying?

328
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Just an Iwi expression.

329
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It means
that you're very brave.

330
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
-Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

331
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Hey, use a light touch
on the sedatives.

332
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
He's our escort.

333
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
We can't have him comatose
when we reach Hollow Earth.

334
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
What if Kong
doesn't go willingly?

335
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
-What do you do then?
-

336
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Dr. Lind, please report

337
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
to the forward deck. Dr. Lind.

338
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Excuse me.

339
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
New arrivals.

340
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
-

341
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Welcome.

342
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Wow. Who's the idiot
who came up with this idea?

343
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
-Ha-ha.
-I'm Maia Simmons.

344
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
My father sent me.

345
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I run point for Apex.

346
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Nathan Lind, mission chief.

347
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Yeah, don't worry.
I'm just here to babysit.

348
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
-

349
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
The Hollow Earth
Aerial Vehicles

350
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
are on their way to Antarctica
as we speak.

351
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I know you people
think you're cutting-edge,

352
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
but these prototypes
we're loaning you

353
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
will make what you've been
flying look like used Miatas.

354
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I love Miatas.

355
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Forget about the price tag,
which is obscene, of course.

356
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
The antigravity engines
alone produce

357
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
enough charge
to light up Vegas for a week.

358
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Feel free to be impressed.

359
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Wow.

360
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
All right, we'll be

361
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
at the Antarctica entry
in 48 hours.

362
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
This path will get us
into Hollow Earth.

363
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Once we're inside, Kong should
lead us to the power source.

364
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Now, the gravitational
inversion

365
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
will be quite intense.

366
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Our best guess
is that on entry,

367
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
it'll feel like
bungee jumping...

368
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
with the cord tied
to your lower intestine.

369
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
But if your helicopters
are as good as you say...

370
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
HEAVs.

371
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
If your HEAVs are as good
as you say they are,

372
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I believe we can do this.

373
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
They'll do the job.

374
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You just gotta do yours.

375
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Excellent.

376
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Dr. Andrews.

377
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
We've avoided
all of Godzilla's

378
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
according to your guidelines.

379
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Good.

380
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Do I need to be concerned?

381
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Yes. They do have a way
of sensing threats.

382
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And we believe that they had
an ancient rivalry.

383
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
The myths say
that their ancestors

384
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
fought each other
in a great war.

385
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So if they meet again,
who bows to who, is that it?

386
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
No, I spent 10 years
on that island studying him.

387
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I know this for sure.

388
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Kong bows to no one.

389
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Is she supposed
to be out there?

390
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
-

391
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Jia, come on. Come on.

392
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Did the monkey just talk?

393
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Okay, class, listen up.

394
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
In the midst of Godzilla's
attack on Apex Pensacola,

395
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I found some crazy tech with
no official classification.

396
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
What I saw doesn't match

397
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
any of the engineering specs
I've ever seen.

398
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So what are they working on
in such blackout secrecy, hmm?

399
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
This could be the thread
that finally unravels

400
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
the Apex sweater
of conspiracy.

401
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You better believe
I'm gonna keep tugging.

402
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
For now, I'm secure.

403
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Anonymous
and hiding in plain sight

404
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
as I continue my mission.

405
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Breaking the law

406
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Breaking the law

407
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
To be clear, my brother can
never know we took his van.

408
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Josh, to be clear, even if
we got into an accident,

409
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I don't think he could tell.

410
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
No, no, my brother would never
let you drive either.

411
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
My mission, my wheel.

412
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I just don't think
it's a good idea,

413
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
looking for some secret weirdo
off the Internet.

414
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I mean, we just had
an assembly about this.

415
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
He's not a weirdo.
He's a covert investigator.

416
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And he's the only one
looking for the truth

417
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
about Godzilla and Apex.

418
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So let him look.
Why do we have to help him?

419
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Because...

420
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
If we don't, nobody else will.

421
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Are you coming or not?

422
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Obviously I'm coming.

423
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It's stuck.

424
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
-Wait, wait, wait, wait!

425
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Mind control.

426
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Psionic link technology
is a reality.

427
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
That's right.
One brain controlling another.

428
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Oh, man.

429
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Imagine that
on a global scale

430
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
and Apex is invincible.

431
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
We've been listening
to this weirdo for hours.

432
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-

433
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Whoa! Knock it off!

434
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Wait, this is the part
I was telling you about.

435
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
...need special UV to
even know you've been marked!

436
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
One or two gallons
won't cut it.

437
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I need my bleach in bulk!

438
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Because spy dust
is real, people!

439
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I mean, come on,
invisible to the naked eye...

440
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
-That's how we find him.

441
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
-The bleach.
-Bleach?

442
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
He consumes a ton of bleach.

443
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
He drinks bleach?

444
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Showers with it.

445
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Oh! Yeah, I shower
with bleach. No, what?

446
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Prevention against
organic tracking technology.

447
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
See? Tradecraft.

448
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Would've made more sense
if he just drank it.

449
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Come on,
just one more place.

450
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Madison, this is getting old.

451
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Hey, you sell bleach?

452
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Is this another one of those
Internet challenge things?

453
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
When I sold those kids
those detergent pods,

454
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I didn't know
they were gonna eat them.

455
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I'm still dealing
with the lawsuits from that.

456
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Look, we're looking for a guy

457
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
who works
for Apex Cybernetics.

458
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Buys a lot of bleach.
Like every night.

459
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
He's probably paranoid,

460
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
high-strung,
doesn't like daylight.

461
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
You know, has a lot of crumbs
in his beard,

462
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
if he has a beard.

463
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Okay, look,
you kids want some candy?

464
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Because I can help you
with candy.

465
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Look at me in the eye. Okay?
I need information.

466
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Yeah, we want lots of candy.

467
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
What are you doing?
You think...?

468
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Oh, you mean Bernie.

469
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Yeah, I know that guy.

470
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
He buys,
like, a ton of bleach.

471
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I know where he is, too.

472
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
If you buy a live fish,
I'll give you his address.

473
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Bernie?

474
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Mister...
Mis...

475
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
-

476
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Mister Bernie not home.

477
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Yep, that was
definitely Mister Bernie.

478
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Yeah. Um...

479
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Hi! Hi. Listen, we wanna talk
about Apex and Godzilla.

480
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
No. No. No.

481
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I... I got your faces.
I contact authorities. Yes.

482
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
For knocking on a door?

483
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
No. No.

484
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Bernie, you don't trust
the authorities.

485
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
My name is Madison Russell.

486
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
My father works for Monarch
and my mother was...

487
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Emma Russell, right?

488
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Before we go any farther,
I got one question.

489
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Tap or no tap?

490
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
No tap.

491
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
-Excuse me, what is "tap"?
-Water.

492
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
They put fluoride in it.
Learned it from the Nazis.

493
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Theory is it makes you docile,
easy to manipulate.

494
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Oh, I drink tap water.

495
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Yeah, I kind of figured that.

496
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But she does the thinking
for both of you,

497
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
so it should be all right.

498
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
-Thanks.
-Okay.

499
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
What you got?

500
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I believe Godzilla's
most recent attacks

501
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
haven't just been random.

502
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I think he targeted
the Apex facility.

503
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I'm of the same opinion.

504
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
But why? What is Apex up to
that's provoking him?

505
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
For five years, I embedded
myself inside this company,

506
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
trying to figure out
what their game was.

507
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Then, last week...

508
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I saw this.

509
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
A manifest of huge cargo
being sent from here

510
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
to Apex headquarters
in Hong Kong,

511
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
which makes no sense

512
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
because we are not equipped
for heavy shipping.

513
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
-Then what?
-And then boom!

514
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Godzilla shows up.

515
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Caved in half the facility,

516
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
but I got a sneak peek
at some suspicious tech

517
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
which was hidden
in a secret bunker.

518
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I mean, some pretty
damn suspicious tech.

519
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Yeah, but what is that?

520
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
That's, um...

521
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
That's Katzunari
single malt whiskey.

522
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Yeah, but it's
in a gun holster.

523
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It was a gift from my Sara.

524
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
You have a Sara?

525
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
She was my wife.

526
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Um, she passed on.

527
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
She was my rock.

528
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
My truth.

529
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I'll tell you something,
the day that this goes empty,

530
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
that's the day
you know I've given up.

531
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Bernie.

532
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I think we can
help each other.

533
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Okay, I guess
now that we're a team,

534
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I feel like we should
come up with a plan.

535
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
We're breaking into Apex.

536
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Wait, what?
- You heard her.

537
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Tap water.

538
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Shit.

539
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Hey.

540
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Thank you.

541
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
How is she?

542
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Calm. So calm, it's scary.

543
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
That was extraordinary.

544
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I have been signing
the alphabet. Basic commands.

545
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I thought that he showed
recognition, but he never...

546
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Do you have any idea how long
they've been communicating?

547
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
No.

548
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I knew that they had a bond.

549
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
He trusts her.

550
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Without her, he'd be
tearing the ship apart.

551
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You know, Jia's parents
were killed on the island.

552
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
When the storm
took over the island,

553
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
it wiped out
the native people.

554
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
But Kong saved her.

555
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
She had nowhere to go.

556
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
So I made a promise,

557
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
then and there,
to protect her.

558
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
And I think that in some way,
he did the same.

559
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Do you think he would take
directions from her?

560
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
No.

561
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
If we have someone who can
keep the reins on Kong...

562
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Yeah, no one can keep
the reins on Kong.

563
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And she's a child.

564
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I know
Jia is only a child.

565
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
But she's the only one
he'll communicate with.

566
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And we need Kong
to find that power source.

567
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
The world needs him.

568
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
What's she saying?

569
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Godzilla.

570
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
-

571
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Did we change course?

572
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
No. We're nowhere near
the areas you flagged.

573
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
It looks like
he's coming for us anyway.

574
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
He's not coming for us.

575
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Him? Then dump him.
Dump the monkey!

576
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
How about we throw you off
instead, huh?

577
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
We have to release him.

578
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
If we lose Kong,
the mission is over.

579
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
He's a sitting duck out there.

580
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
We have to let him
protect himself. And us.

581
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Oh, my God, Jia!

582
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Nathan?

583
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
He needs our help.

584
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
There must be some way
to disorient Godzilla.

585
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Depth charges.

586
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
He's circling back.

587
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
This won't end
until one of them submits.

588
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Shut it down.
-What?

589
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
All of it.

590
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Guns, engines.

591
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
-Shut it down. Right now.
-If we do that, we're dead.

592
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
No, we're playing dead.

593
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
And we're making him think
that he's won.

594
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Cut the power.
Cut the engines.

595
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Kill anything
that makes a noise.

596
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
This better work.

597
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
As soon as we move,
he'll be back.

598
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
How are we supposed
to get the rest of the way?

599
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
How's Kong with heights?

600
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
So, what's the plan?

601
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
We find out
what's on Sublevel 33.

602
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
- Ow.

603
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Keep it moving, tap water.

604
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Go ahead.

605
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
All right, Mad Hatter.
Down the rabbit hole.

606
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Okay. We got this.

607
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Oh, my God!

608
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Are you sure
we can trust this guy?

609
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Yeah, why?

610
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Well, mainly because he says
crazy shit all the time

611
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
and carries
a bottle of whiskey

612
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
from his dead wife like a gun.

613
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I think it's romantic.

614
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Whoo-hoo!

615
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I really don't
understand women.

616
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Okay, come on.

617
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
-

618
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
This whole thing came
down, and there was this...

619
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
eye.

620
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Uh, what are
we looking at?

621
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
No, no, no, no.
No, it was here.

622
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I swear to God, it was...
it was right there.

623
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Hey, guys.

624
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
-

625
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Anyone know
where this leads to?

626
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
You believe me, right?

627
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
'Cause I know that
there was something here.

628
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I'm gonna get a migraine
from that torch.

629
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
"Sublevel." How deep
does this thing go, Bernie?

630
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Hell. Goes to hell.

631
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Sublevel 33.

632
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Maglev shuttle departure

633
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
to Roswell, New Mexico
at 0900 hours.

634
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
What is all this?

635
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
It's breakaway civilization.

636
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I mean, come on.
This is page one

637
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
in the Apex-playing-God
handbook. Huh?

638
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I mean, the Illuminati
running shadow economies

639
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
all to fund a hidden colony
for the elite

640
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
in case any
of these governments

641
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
and megacorporations

642
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
accidentally hit
the doomsday button.

643
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
It makes sense

644
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
-if you think about it.
-Yeah, sure.

645
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Someone's coming.
-What?

646
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
-Someone's coming.
-What?

647
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Someone's coming?
- Yes!

648
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Oh, my God.

649
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
They look like eggs.
-Skull-crawlers.

650
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
What's Apex doing
with skull-crawlers?

651
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
All right,
let's load it up!

652
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
-

653
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
What was that?
What was that?

654
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
-No way. No, no, no. Come on.

655
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Okay, guys,
I think we're moving.

656
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
It says we're headed

657
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
to Apex headquarters
in Hong Kong.

658
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
-What?
- Hong Kong.

659
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
That means that we're gonna
get some answers.

660
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
G10, clear for launch.

661
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Here we go.

662
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
We're getting close!

663
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
-

664
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
It's not working.

665
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Just wait. Wait, wait, wait.

666
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
What if she tells him

667
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
there are others
down there like him?

668
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
But you don't know that.

669
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
We lost our entire fleet
getting here.

670
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
There's no way back for him.

671
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
And he can't survive here.

672
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
All right. All right.

673
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Hey.

674
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
He's going. Prepare to launch!
Everybody to their station.

675
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
We gotta go.

676
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
All flights crews cleared

677
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
for immediate HEAV launch.

678
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
HEAV 1 online.
We're clear for launch.

679
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Copy that, HEAV 1.

680
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
HEAV 2 online.
Exiting hangar now.

681
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
HEAV 2,
confirmation 4055.

682
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
This is HEAV 3
online, launching now.

683
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
We'll follow him from behind.

684
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
There.

685
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
There he is.

686
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Are you sure the monkey's
gonna survive this?

687
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Oh, he'll be fine.
It's us I'd worry about.

688
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
We're about to be launched
1,000 miles in two seconds

689
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
until gravity inverts itself
and spits us into free fall.

690
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
It'll be the most amazing
thing you've ever seen.

691
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Here. For the vomit.

692
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
What?

693
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Engine failure, gravity low.

694
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
-Engine failure.
-

695
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
All Delta, reverse gravity
propulsion!

696
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
It's beautiful.

697
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
This is HEAV 3,

698
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
we're getting some
strange radar activity.

699
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
We're gonna circle back and...

700
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
All Delta, prepare to attack!

701
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
That's gross.

702
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Kong's on the move.

703
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
We gotta go.

704
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Well, he seems to know

705
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Oh, he certainly can move.

706
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Okay, okay.

707
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Creepy monorail
is slowing down.

708
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Attention:
Shipping pod arriving.

709
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Okay. Keep quiet.
Follow me.

710
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
We're going in?

711
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Yeah.

712
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Oh, no!

713
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Every time, I swear.
Doors hate us.

714
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Oh, yeah.

715
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Aah!
- Oh, my God!

716
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:16,000
It's just so massive.
It's so stupid.

717
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
So, what is this place?

718
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Well, if there's
a corporate-friendly term

719
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
I'd say we are in it.

720
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Oh, God, that stinks.

721
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
That's not good. Bernie!

722
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
I really hate this place.

723
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Attention: Demonstration

724
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
in T-minus one minute.

725
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
All personnel
are to stay clear of the area.

726
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Mr. Simmons,
systems are coming online now.

727
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Commence uplink.

728
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Engaging uplink.

729
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Pilot engaged.

730
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
That's robot Godzilla.

731
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Oh, no. That's...

732
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
That's Mechagodzilla.

733
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Release number 10.

734
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Go, go!
Go through there!

735
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Madison! Run, girl!

736
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
-

737
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Yes!

738
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
-

739
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
System only reached 40% power.

740
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Oh, I know.

741
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
As expected.

742
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Don't worry.
Once the Hollow Earth

743
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
sample is uploaded,

744
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
our power troubles
will be over.

745
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
If they can find
the source.

746
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Oh, they'll find it.
I have faith in my daughter.

747
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I have faith in our creation.

748
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And humanity
will once again...

749
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
be the apex species.

750
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,000
This is why Godzilla attacked
the Apex facility.

751
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
They're trying
to replace him.

752
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Come on, Maddie.

753
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Sir,
Godzilla just made

754
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
in direction.
He's moving very fast.

755
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Projections show he's likely
headed to Hong Kong.

756
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Transport is ready and waiting
to take you there, sir.

757
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
That has to be it.

758
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
We were right.

759
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
He's home.

760
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
All personnel must display

761
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
their Apex employee badge
at all times.

762
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Follow me.

763
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Lizard people
build all their facilities

764
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
the same way.
I can find the exit.

765
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
The exit's this way.

766
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Guys. Madison!

767
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Oh, my God.

768
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Bitch, what?

769
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
It's a Titan skull.

770
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
No, no, no.
That's not just any Titan.

771
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
That's Monster Zero.

772
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Ghidorah.

773
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
They hardwired its DNA.

774
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Self-generating
neural pathways

775
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
capable of intuitive learning.

776
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Okay, I'm smart,
but I only go to high school.

777
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
-It's a living supercomputer.
- Shh.

778
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
It had three heads.

779
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Its necks were so long,

780
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
they communicated
telepathically.

781
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
And there's one here

782
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
and another one
inside of that thing.

783
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Yeah, it could be
a psionic interface.

784
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Oh, my God.

785
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Careful.

786
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
It's a pilot.

787
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Yeah.
He's in a trance.

788
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
That's a psionic uplink.

789
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
It follows his will.

790
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Oh, Apex, what have you done?

791
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
-

792
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
This is the day we feared.
I've given the order, Doctor.

793
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
-The city is being evacuated.

794
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I don't understand.
He led us here. Where is it?

795
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
What is he doing?

796
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
It's the axe.

797
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
It's drawing radiation
from the core

798
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
like it's charging.

799
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Whoa! Godzilla's
responding! They found it!

800
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
What in the hell?

801
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
What are you doing?

802
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Extracting a sample.

803
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
This is a power
beyond our understanding.

804
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
You can't just drill into it.

805
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Actually, we can.

806
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
My father gets what he wants.

807
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
That's Apex property now.

808
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
What?

809
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Energy signature incoming.

810
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
We should be able
to recreate it soon.

811
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
That is the discovery
of the millennium.

812
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
-You can't strip it for parts.
-Hold it.

813
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Go. Go. Got what we needed.

814
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Let's go!

815
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Yes.

816
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Mr. Serizawa,
start your engines!

817
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
The upgrade is untested.

818
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Once we get online,

819
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Gojira  will come
straight for us.

820
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
He's been coming for us

821
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
since our creation
first awoke.

822
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
-We must embrace it.
-We shouldn't rush this.

823
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
We have no idea
how this energy source

824
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
will affect the Mecha.

825
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Get in the goddamn chair.

826
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Go, go, go!
- Come on, come on!

827
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Move! What are you
waiting for? Let's go!

828
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
This way, sir! Hurry!
We gotta get back...

829
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
-

830
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Okay.

831
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
-

832
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Get him out of the way!
Shoot him!

833
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
-Go, go, go!
-

834
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
-

835
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Oh, no.

836
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
No, no, no...

837
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Oh, Jesus!
Come on, let's go!

838
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
-Hold on, ladies.
-Yeah.

839
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Whoa.

840
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Stay low.

841
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Yeah. Going viral.

842
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
What?

843
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
We've gotta try and stop this.

844
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Mm-mm. I don't like this, guys.

845
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
If this wasn't contributing
to world destruction,

846
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
this would be
a great DJ booth.

847
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I know what it... Maintenance.

848
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
-Madison, we should go.

849
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I'm Maintenance.
You don't have to alert the...

850
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
She doesn't buy that.
Uh, Madison, we need to go.

851
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
The woman
with the villain hairdo...

852
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Madison, they have guns.

853
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Hey, guys. Uh, it's soundproof
so I can't really...

854
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
-I wanna communicate...
-Open the door!

855
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Say again?

856
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Oh, God!
Get down! Get down!

857
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Oh, shit!

858
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
-

859
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
We're about to breach
the veil! Hold on!

860
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
-

861
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Looks like round two
goes to Kong.

862
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Hey!

863
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Oh, come on, guys.
Really? Greenpeace again?

864
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Greenpea...

865
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Actually, sir, not like
you would know this,

866
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
but I'm Level Two
Assistant Engineering...

867
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Well, Provisional Level Two
Assistant Engineering,

868
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
not like you would know that.

869
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
My evaluations
were incredibly encourag...

870
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I'm just saying Greenpeace
wishes, is all I'm saying.

871
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Where do I know you from?

872
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Oh, my goodness.

873
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Director Russell's daughter,
yes?

874
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
You caused all of this.

875
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,000
If by "all of this,"
you mean I, and I alone,

876
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
have given humanity a chance
against the Titans,

877
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
then, yes,
I will own that title.

878
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Godzilla had left us in peace.

879
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
You provoked him into war.

880
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
There can only be one alpha,
Miss Russell.

881
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
It seems to have been
providence.

882
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
It's time to launch.

883
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Begin pilot integration.

884
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
And now...

885
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
my Mecha.

886
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,000
It's not only
Godzilla's equal...

887
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
but his superior.

888
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
The Apex Titan of my own hand.

889
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,000
It's time to show
the world what you can do.

890
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Pilot engaged.

891
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Alert: Failure.
System unstable.

892
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Alert: Failure.
System unstable.

893
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
This is how we,
as a species, win.

894
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
You see, 10 years ago,

895
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,000
when  Gojira  was first revealed
to the world,

896
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
I had a dream.

897
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
And in that dream,
I saw one thing.

898
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:18,000
And that beautiful,
amazing thing was...

899
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Oh, shit.

900
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,000
No!

901
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,000
I really wanted to hear
the rest of that speech.

902
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
What in God's name is that?

903
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
It's thinking for itself now.

904
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
We have to warn Monarch.

905
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Or try to stop it ourselves.

906
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
That thing's still linked
to their satellite.

907
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Wait, Josh.

908
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
If I can figure out
the password,

909
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
maybe we can shut it down.

910
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
All right.

911
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
What the hell is that?

912
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
What?

913
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
What's happening?

914
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
She can feel his heartbeat.

915
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
He's dying.

916
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
There's nothing we can do
to restart his heart.

917
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
We'd need a charge
big enough to...

918
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Light up Las Vegas for a week.

919
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Is that a password?
-

920
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Is that a password?

921
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
I don't know!
I'm not used to this.

922
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
I'm used to pirating
movies online.

923
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
-Okay, then go to Settings.
-

924
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
This is Mark.
-Dad?

925
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Madison, where are you?

926
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Dad, can you hear...

927
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Can you hear me?
I'm in Hong Kong.

928
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
-Mad?
-Dad!

929
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Mad? Madison!

930
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
-A-ha!

931
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Okay, you two better
get some distance.

932
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Hey.

933
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,000
You are
a very brave little girl.

934
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
I don't know.

935
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Maybe we both are.

936
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
-

937
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Okay.

938
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Good luck, big fella.

939
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
-

940
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
-

941
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
I thought you said
you were a hacker!

942
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
I said I took an HTML course
at summer camp.

943
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
-HTML?
-Yes, at summer camp.

944
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Was it a '90s camp?
Come on. Use QWERTY.

945
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Error. Security lock.

946
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
- No. Shit!

947
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Shit.

948
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
-

949
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Josh!
You have to do something.

950
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
We tried to take down
those Apex bastards,

951
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
but I think this is
as far as we go,

952
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,000
so bottom's up.

953
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I was hoping to die
with adults, but okay.

954
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,000
If you've never
had a drink before,

955
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Drink. Drink!

956
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Hey! What are you...
-

957
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
That's your solution?

958
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
I gotta die here with you,
and sober!

959
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Yeah!
- Yes! Yes!

960
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Hey, Nathan?

961
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
-Nathan?
-

962
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Nathan, are you okay?

963
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Dad?

964
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Dad!

965
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Dad!

966
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Hi. Um, it was, um...
Madison's idea.

967
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Shut up, Josh.

968
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Dad. This is the man
who saved our lives.

969
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Bernie, meet Dad.

970
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Dad. Uh, Bernie.

971
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Um, it's an absolute pleasure
to meet you.

972
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,000
I was wondering
if I could invite you

973
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,000
to talk about the Monarch
facility in Roswell because...

974
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
It's amazing. It happened...

975
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
-

976
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Jia? Jia!

977
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Heads up, guys! He's coming
